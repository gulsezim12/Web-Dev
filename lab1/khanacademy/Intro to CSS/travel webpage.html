        <p>1)Fuji is an active stratovolcano that last erupted in 1707. In clear weather, it can be seen even from Tokyo, but all the beauty is better appreciated from the numerous viewing platforms.</p>

        <p>2)Endless flower fields and hills sprawl right on the shores of the Pacific Ocean in the Ibaraki region on an area of about 215 hectares. The appearance of the park varies depending on the season, but at any time of the year it remains a place of attraction for nature lovers.</p>

        <p>3)One of the most amazing places in Japan, where wild Japanese macaques roam freely in their natural environment. This is the northernmost non-hominid monkey habitat in the world.</p>
